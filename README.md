# Codsoft-C++Internship Projects

Welcome to my C++ internship project portfolio! This repository showcases various C++-based projects I developed during my internship to enhance my programming, problem-solving, and object-oriented design skills.

##  Project/Task List 
### 1.🎯 Random Number Guessing Game (C++)

This is a simple C++ console-based game where the program generates a random number between a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

### 🔧 Features
- Generates a new random number on each run

- Gives real-time feedback on user guesses

- Simple input validation

- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- Using random number generation (rand(), srand())

- Loops and conditional statements

- Basic I/O with cin and cout

### 2. 🧮 Basic Calculator in C++
This is a simple console-based calculator written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and select the desired operation. The program then computes and displays the result.

### 🔧 Features
- Supports four basic operations: +, -, *, /

- User-friendly input prompts

- Input validation for division by zero

- Clear and simple output formatting

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How to use cin and cout for user input and output

- Implementing conditional logic using if/else or switch statements

- Performing arithmetic operations in C++

- Validating user input (e.g. preventing division by zero)

- Organizing code for readability and reusability

### 3.❌⭕ Console-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++
This is a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ that runs in the console. It uses a 3x3 grid and allows two players to take turns placing their markers ("X" and "O") until there's a win or a draw.

### 🎮 Features
- 3x3 grid game board

- Two-player support ("X" and "O")

- Display of current game board after each move

- Input prompt for player moves with position selection

- Valid move checking and board updates

- Win condition detection for rows, columns, and diagonals

- Draw detection if the board is full with no winner

- Turn switching between players

- Game result display (Win, Draw)

- Option to play again after game ends

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- Using arrays or vectors to represent the game board

- Implementing loops and conditional logic for game flow

- Validating user input to prevent invalid or duplicate moves

- Checking for win/draw conditions in a 2D grid

- Creating clean and modular code for better structure

- Enhancing user experience through prompts and display formatting

### 4.✅ Console-Based To-Do List Manager in C++
This is a simple console-based To-Do List Manager written in C++ that allows users to add, view, complete, and delete tasks. It provides a basic but functional interface for task management directly in the terminal.

### 📋 Features
- Add Task: Users can input new tasks to add to their list

- View Tasks: Display all tasks with their status (Pending ✅ /      Completed ✔️)

- Mark as Completed: Update a task's status to "Completed"

- Remove Task: Delete a task from the list

- Persistent Loop: Allows users to perform multiple actions until they choose to exit

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How to use arrays, vectors, or structs to store data

- Implementing menus and loops for continuous interaction

- Using conditional logic to manage task states

- Handling string and integer input in C++

- Writing modular functions for better code structure

- Basics of managing user-driven lists in a console application

### 5.📚 Library Management System in C++
This is a simple console-based Library Management System written in C++ that helps manage books, borrowers, and transactions. It allows users (such as librarians) to perform key library functions like checking books in/out, searching the catalog, and tracking overdue fines.

### 📖 Features
-Book Database: Store book details including title, author, and ISBN

- Search Functionality: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN

- Book Checkout: Issue books to registered borrowers

- Book Return: Handle book returns and update availability

- Fine Calculation: Calculate overdue fines based on return date

- User Interface: Text-based menu-driven interface for ease of use

### 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- Structuring a program using classes or structs for books and users

- Working with arrays, vectors, or file I/O to store persistent data

- Handling date and time calculations for overdue returns

- mplementing search algorithms for querying records

- Designing a basic yet functional user interface in the console

- Applying real-world logic like availability status and fine rules
